# Aegis - The All-in-One Community Management Bot

Aegis is a modular Discord bot designed to handle a wide range of community management tasks. Each major feature resides in its own module so that the codebase stays maintainable and easy to extend.

## Philosophy

- **Maintain Modularity**: Develop new features as individual cogs under `src/modules/`.
- **Abstract Core Logic**: Place common helpers in `src/utils/` to avoid code duplication.
- **Prioritize Documentation**: Every function and class must include clear docstrings and inline comments describing its behavior.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install Python dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Configure your environment variables (bot token, database URL, etc.).
4. Add new modules under `src/modules/` and share helpers in `src/utils/`.

## Features Overview

- Dynamic voice channel management
- Server economy with virtual shop
- User leveling system
- Administrator toolkit
- Music playback
