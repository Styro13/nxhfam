# Project Nxhfam

This repository serves as a clean starting point for a modular application. The project emphasizes creating self-contained modules (cogs) for new features while sharing core functionality through central utilities. 

## Guidelines

- **Maintain Modularity:** Implement each feature in its own module to keep the codebase organized.
- **Abstract Core Logic:** Place shared functionality in `src/utils/` to prevent code duplication.
- **Prioritize Documentation:** Document functions, classes, and modules with docstrings and comments.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies for your environment.
3. Add new modules under `src/modules/` and shared utilities under `src/utils/`.

Contributions are welcome! Please follow the guidelines above when submitting pull requests.
